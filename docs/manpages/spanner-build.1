Build git repos from bob-plans

.SH SYNOPSIS
spanner build [uri] [plans]... <option>

.SH DESCRIPTION

Spanner build command builds git repos into conary packages from bob plans using a wms control site. Spanner uses a config directory (projects) populated with build plans for all the packages it intends to build. This directory is located in a git repo for version control and branching. 

Git information is located using WMS. WMS keeps track of the important information from git repos in a rest interface. As well as creating a forest of git repos using a control.yaml file containing all pertaining repos in the control git repo.

Spanner leverages the WMS REST interface to find all related git information. In build mode spanner reads WMS control file for revisions, checks out the plans from the control repo, reads the config files, and creates a list of packages to build. The tool then iterates through the list and checks the git commit version and compares it to the version of the package in the corresponding conary repo. If the commit and the version do not match spanner passes the package off to bob the builder to be built. 

When the group switch is specified spanner uses the versions of the packages from the build run to create a conary group on the conary label in the group.conf file. 

When the includeExternal value is set to True in group.conf spanner will include external packages not built by spanner with build plans located in the external directory.
